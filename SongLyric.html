        <p>[<b>Verse 1: Dean Lewis</b>]<br>
        I'm so scared of falling<br>
        I was in and out, up and down, too afraid to be open<br>
        I found myself in you and it made me feel so fucking scared<br>
        'Cause, when I am open<br>
        All my past and all my pain floats up to the surface<br>
        You can even cut me down with a smile, it hurts so bad<br></p>
        
        <p>[<b>Pre-Chorus: Dean Lewis</b>]<br>
        So, I leave when it gets too good, yeah-yeah<br>
        I leave when it gets too good<br>
        But<br></p>
        
        <p>[<b>Chorus: Dean Lewis, Julia Michaels</b>]<br>
        In a perfect world, I am here with you<br>
        And I kiss you slow in a dim-lit room<br>
        When you ask me if I love you, I say, "I do"<br>
        I'm not running from my problems, and I'm not running from you<br>
        And we're so damn happy, and I'm not confused<br>
        I'm not looking for an escape all 'cause I'm scared I might lose you<br>
        Ooh, in a perfect world<br><br></p>
        
        <p>[<b>Verse 2: Julia Michaels</b>]<br>
        Yeah, at least youâ€™re self-aware, I'll give you some credit<br>
        But walking out on something perfect's really stupid, yeah<br>
        Baby, I said it<br>
        You're so scared of regretting something before you can even regret it<br>
        And we could be great, and it would be great if you'd let it, uh<br></p>
        
        <p>[<b>Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels, Dean Lewis</b>]<br>
        But you leave when it gets too good, yeah-yeah<br>
        You (I) leave when it gets too good<br>
        But<br></p>
        
        <p>[<b>Chorus: Dean Lewis & Julia Michaels</b>]<br>
        In a perfect world, I am here with you<br>
        And I kiss you slow in a dim-lit room<br>
        When you ask me if I love you, I say, "I do"<br>
        I'm not running from my problems, and I'm not running from you<br>
        And we're so damn happy, and I'm not confused<br>
        I'm not looking for an escape all 'cause I'm scared I might lose you<br>
        Ooh, in a perfect world<br></p>
        
        <p>[<b>Bridge: Dean Lewis & Julia Michaels</b>]<br>
        I leave when it gets too good (When it gets too good, you always)<br>
        Leave, leave, when it gets too good<br>
        Oh, but<br></p>
        
        <p>[<b>Outro: Dean Lewis & Julia Michaels</b>]<br>
        In a perfect world, there's just us two<br>
        And I let myself get lost in you<br>
        When you ask me if I love you, I say, "I do"<br>
        I'm not running from my problems, and I'm not running from you<br></p>
